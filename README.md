# DeepLearning-Interpretatbility

Project plan

* Set up the architecture
  * Get the date and set up BERT
  * Use the parameters same as BERT paper to get embeddings.
  * Use a different parameter set to do the same ( if required )
  
  
* Bias detection 
  * Use the setup and bias detection similar to Homemaker paper
  * Figure out a way to look at certain subset of bias, modify the setup, etc
  
* Debiasing
  * Implement Debiasing in the listed papers
  * Modify debiasing techniques
  * Make a transformation function to go from orignal embeddings to debaised ones back and forth.

* Reading
  * BERT + BERT setup
  * Bias and Debias papers 
  
  
* To do : ( work division)
   * Adam - setup architecture and run BERT, 
   * Mohan - 
   * SV- debiasing techniques,
